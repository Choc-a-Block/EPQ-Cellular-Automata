# Project
My EPQ project is to create a cellular automaton simulation engine using python.

## What is a cellular automaton?
A cellular automaton is a discrete model studied in computability theory and mathematical physics.
It consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as on and off.
The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell.
An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell.
A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood.
Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously.
These rules can be used to model simple natural phenomena, such as the growth of patterns in the sand or the behavior of an automaton-like computer program.

## What are the applications of cellular automata?

Cellular automata can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
* Modeling complex systems, such as the spread of disease, the growth of cities, and the spread of forest fires.
* Simulating physical systems, such as the growth of crystals, and fluid dynamics.
* Solving optimization problems
* Creating art, music, and other forms of entertainment
* Developing computer games, such as Conway's Game of Life

## Why did I choose to do this project?
I chose to create this CA engine because I have always been interested in the concept of cellular automata, and I wanted to learn more about them.
I also wanted to learn more about python and how to use it to create a complex CA engine.
