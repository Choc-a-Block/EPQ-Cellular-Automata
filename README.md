# Project
My EPQ project is to create a cellular automaton simulation engine using python.

## What are cellular automata simply?
Cellular automata are a type of discrete model that can be used to simulate complex systems.
They are made up of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of states (usually, these are normalised between 0 and 1).
The grid can be in any number of dimensions, but the most common are 1D, 2D and 3D.
The cells are updated according to a set of rules that are applied to each cell and its neighbours.
The rules are applied simultaneously to all cells, and the new state of each cell is determined by the old state of itself and its neighbours.
The rules are applied repeatedly, and the system evolves over time.

## What are the applications of cellular automata?

Cellular automata can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
* Modeling complex systems, such as the spread of disease, the growth of cities, and the spread of forest fires.
* Simulating physical systems, such as the growth of crystals, and fluid dynamics.
* Solving optimisation problems
* Creating art, music, and other forms of entertainment
* Developing computer games, such as Conway's Game of Life

## Why did I choose to do this project?
I chose to create this CA engine because I have always been interested in the concept of cellular automata, and I wanted to learn more about them.
I also wanted to learn more about python and how to use it to create a complex CA engine.
