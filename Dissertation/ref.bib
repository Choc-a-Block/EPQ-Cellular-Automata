	abstract = {Modeling the ability of multicellular organisms to build and maintain their bodies through local interactions between individual cells (morphogenesis) is a long-standing challenge of developmental biology. Recently, the Neural Cellular Automata ({NCA}) model was proposed as a way to find local system rules that produce a desired global behaviour, such as growing and persisting a predefined target pattern, by repeatedly applying the same rule over a grid starting from a single cell. In this work, we argue that the original Growing {NCA} model has an important limitation: anisotropy of the learned update rule. This implies the presence of an external factor that orients the cells in a particular direction. In other words, "physical" rules of the underlying system are not invariant to rotation, thus prohibiting the existence of differently oriented instances of the target pattern on the same grid. We propose a modified Isotropic {NCA} ({IsoNCA}) model that does not have this limitation. We demonstrate that such cell systems can be trained to grow accurate asymmetrical patterns through either of two methods: (1) by breaking symmetries using structured seeds or (2) by introducing a rotation-reflection invariant training objective and relying on symmetry-breaking caused by asynchronous cell updates.},

	abstract = {Quantum Dot Cellular Automata ({QCA}) is a newly developed paradigm for digital design, which holds the potential to be the possible alternative to the present {CMOS} (Complementary Metal Oxide Semi-Conductor) technology. After surviving for nearly five decades, the scaling of {CMOS} is finally reaching its limits. The asperities are not only seen from the physical and technological viewpoint but also from the material and economical perspectives. With no more scaling possible, there arises a need to look for promising alternatives to continue with the nano size/scale computations and to hold on to the Moore’s law. {QCA} offers a breakthrough required for the fulfilment of certain lacking aspects of {CMOS} technology in the nano regime. {QCA} is a technology that involves no current transfer but works on electronic interaction between the cells. The {QCA} cell basically consists of quantum dots or metal islands separated by certain distance and the entire transmission of information occurs via the interaction between the electrons localized in these potential wells. Since the technology is new and in a premature phase, a huge scope lies ahead of the researchers to investigate and make {QCA} designing a reality. In this paper the {QCA} technology is reviewed with sufficient focus on basic concepts, implementations and information flow. The various building blocks in {QCA} are discussed and their working on the basis of physical laws is explained.  This paper forms the basis for further complex digital designing in {QCA}.},

Computer simulations show that Lenia supports a great diversity of complex autonomous patterns or "lifeforms" bearing resemblance to real-world microscopic organisms. More than 400 species in 18 families have been identified, many discovered via interactive evolutionary computation. They differ from other cellular automata patterns in being geometric, metameric, fuzzy, resilient, adaptive, and rule-generic. We present basic observations of the system regarding the properties of space-time and basic settings. We provide a broad survey of the lifeforms, categorize them into a hierarchical taxonomy, and map their distribution in the parameter hyperspace. We describe their morphological structures and behavioral dynamics, propose possible mechanisms of their self-propulsion, self-organization and plasticity. Finally, we discuss how the study of Lenia would be related to biology, artificial life, and artificial intelligence.},

Sensitive Sum, a new fuzzy operator is proposed to employ a parallel connection between the effects of separate variables while taking into account the (statistical) correlation between them. As a result, the model implements a reducible/extensible form of Knowledge Base which can include both data-driven and empirical rules and does not require certain variables/data to run. In order to simulate urban growth Cellular Automata techniques are incorporated that are enhanced by pseudo-agent behavior. The proposed model is applied in the broader Mesogia area in east Attica (Athens, Greece) for the period 2000-2007 during which urban land cover grew by 66\% and appears to capture the urban growth dynamics occurred in a satisfactory way.},

On the other hand, an Arithmetic Logic Unit ({ALU}) is a digital electronic circuit which performs arithmetic and bitwise logical operations on integer binary numbers. Therefore, {QCA}-based {ALU} is an important part of the processor in order to develop a full capability processor. Although the {QCA} has become very important, there is not any comprehensive and systematic work on studying and analyzing its important techniques in the field of {ALU} design. This paper provides the comprehensive, systematic and detailed study and survey of the state-of-the-art techniques and mechanisms in the field of {QCA}-based {ALU} designing. There are three categories in which {QCA} plays a role: {ALU}, logic unit ({LU}) and arithmetic unit ({AU}). Each category presents the important studies. In addition, this paper reviews the major developments in these three categories and it plans the new challenges. Furthermore, it provides the identification of open issues and guidelines for future research. Also, a Systematic Literature Review ({SLR}) on {QCA}-based {ALU}, {LU} and {AU} is discussed in this paper. We identified 1,960 papers, which are reduced to 26 primary studies through our paper selection process. According to the obtained results from 2001 to 2015, the number of published articles are very high in 2014 and low in 2005 and 2009. This survey paper also provides a discussion of considered mechanisms in terms of {ALU}, {LU} and {AU} attribute as well as directions for future research.},

Now, Cellular Automata: A Discrete View of the World presents the thrust of the classic Wolfram text in a straightforward, introductory manner. Utilizing at times, novel material, this book provides an introduction to cellular automata as a constructive method for modeling the behavior of a wide range of complex systems (from bacteria to perhaps the universe itself), where patterns of self-organization arising from simple rules are revealed. Some of the material is presented for the first time in book form. The highly visual nature of the subject is accented with over 200 illustrations (8 pages of which are in color), that provide vivid representations of the cellular automata under discussion. Readers can create their own cellular automata using Java(tm) applets and simple computer code, which are available via the book's {FTP} site. This book serves as a valuable resource for undergraduate and graduate students and would be of interest to any reader with a scientific background.},
